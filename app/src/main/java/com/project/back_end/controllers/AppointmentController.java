package com.project.back_end.controllers;


public class AppointmentController {

// 1. Set Up the Controller Class:
//    - Annotate the class with `@RestController` to define it as a REST API controller.
//    - Use `@RequestMapping("/appointments")` to set a base path for all appointment-related endpoints.
//    - This centralizes all routes that deal with booking, updating, retrieving, and canceling appointments.


// 2. Autowire Dependencies:
//    - Inject `AppointmentService` for handling the business logic specific to appointments.
//    - Inject the general `Service` class, which provides shared functionality like token validation and appointment checks.


// 3. Define the `getAppointments` Method:
//    - Handles HTTP GET requests to fetch appointments based on date and patient name.
//    - Takes the appointment date, patient name, and token as path variables.
//    - First validates the token for role `"doctor"` using the `Service`.
//    - If the token is valid, returns appointments for the given patient on the specified date.
//    - If the token is invalid or expired, responds with the appropriate message and status code.


// 4. Define the `bookAppointment` Method:
//    - Handles HTTP POST requests to create a new appointment.
//    - Accepts a validated `Appointment` object in the request body and a token as a path variable.
//    - Validates the token for the `"patient"` role.
//    - Uses service logic to validate the appointment data (e.g., check for doctor availability and time conflicts).
//    - Returns success if booked, or appropriate error messages if the doctor ID is invalid or the slot is already taken.


// 5. Define the `updateAppointment` Method:
//    - Handles HTTP PUT requests to modify an existing appointment.
//    - Accepts a validated `Appointment` object and a token as input.
//    - Validates the token for `"patient"` role.
//    - Delegates the update logic to the `AppointmentService`.
//    - Returns an appropriate success or failure response based on the update result.


// 6. Define the `cancelAppointment` Method:
//    - Handles HTTP DELETE requests to cancel a specific appointment.
//    - Accepts the appointment ID and a token as path variables.
//    - Validates the token for `"patient"` role to ensure the user is authorized to cancel the appointment.
//    - Calls `AppointmentService` to handle the cancellation process and returns the result.
