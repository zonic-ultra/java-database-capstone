package com.project.back_end.services;

public class DoctorService {

// 1. **Add @Service Annotation**:
//    - This class should be annotated with `@Service` to indicate that it is a service layer class.
//    - The `@Service` annotation marks this class as a Spring-managed bean for business logic.
//    - Instruction: Add `@Service` above the class declaration.

// 2. **Constructor Injection for Dependencies**:
//    - The `DoctorService` class depends on `DoctorRepository`, `AppointmentRepository`, and `TokenService`.
//    - These dependencies should be injected via the constructor for proper dependency management.
//    - Instruction: Ensure constructor injection is used for injecting dependencies into the service.

// 3. **Add @Transactional Annotation for Methods that Modify or Fetch Database Data**:
//    - Methods like `getDoctorAvailability`, `getDoctors`, `findDoctorByName`, `filterDoctorsBy*` should be annotated with `@Transactional`.
//    - The `@Transactional` annotation ensures that database operations are consistent and wrapped in a single transaction.
//    - Instruction: Add the `@Transactional` annotation above the methods that perform database operations or queries.

// 4. **getDoctorAvailability Method**:
//    - Retrieves the available time slots for a specific doctor on a particular date and filters out already booked slots.
//    - The method fetches all appointments for the doctor on the given date and calculates the availability by comparing against booked slots.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that the time slots are properly formatted and the available slots are correctly filtered.

// 5. **saveDoctor Method**:
//    - Used to save a new doctor record in the database after checking if a doctor with the same email already exists.
//    - If a doctor with the same email is found, it returns `-1` to indicate conflict; `1` for success, and `0` for internal errors.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that the method correctly handles conflicts and exceptions when saving a doctor.

// 6. **updateDoctor Method**:
//    - Updates an existing doctor's details in the database. If the doctor doesn't exist, it returns `-1`.
//    - Instruction: Make sure that the doctor exists before attempting to save the updated record and handle any errors properly.

// 7. **getDoctors Method**:
//    - Fetches all doctors from the database. It is marked with `@Transactional` to ensure that the collection is properly loaded.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that the collection is eagerly loaded, especially if dealing with lazy-loaded relationships (e.g., available times). 

// 8. **deleteDoctor Method**:
//    - Deletes a doctor from the system along with all appointments associated with that doctor.
//    - It first checks if the doctor exists. If not, it returns `-1`; otherwise, it deletes the doctor and their appointments.
//    - Instruction: Ensure the doctor and their appointments are deleted properly, with error handling for internal issues.

// 9. **validateDoctor Method**:
//    - Validates a doctor's login by checking if the email and password match an existing doctor record.
//    - It generates a token for the doctor if the login is successful, otherwise returns an error message.
//    - Instruction: Make sure to handle invalid login attempts and password mismatches properly with error responses.

// 10. **findDoctorByName Method**:
//    - Finds doctors based on partial name matching and returns the list of doctors with their available times.
//    - This method is annotated with `@Transactional` to ensure that the database query and data retrieval are properly managed within a transaction.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that available times are eagerly loaded for the doctors.


// 11. **filterDoctorsByNameSpecilityandTime Method**:
//    - Filters doctors based on their name, specialty, and availability during a specific time (AM/PM).
//    - The method fetches doctors matching the name and specialty criteria, then filters them based on their availability during the specified time period.
//    - Instruction: Ensure proper filtering based on both the name and specialty as well as the specified time period.

// 12. **filterDoctorByTime Method**:
//    - Filters a list of doctors based on whether their available times match the specified time period (AM/PM).
//    - This method processes a list of doctors and their available times to return those that fit the time criteria.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that the time filtering logic correctly handles both AM and PM time slots and edge cases.


// 13. **filterDoctorByNameAndTime Method**:
//    - Filters doctors based on their name and the specified time period (AM/PM).
//    - Fetches doctors based on partial name matching and filters the results to include only those available during the specified time period.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that the method correctly filters doctors based on the given name and time of day (AM/PM).

// 14. **filterDoctorByNameAndSpecility Method**:
//    - Filters doctors by name and specialty.
//    - It ensures that the resulting list of doctors matches both the name (case-insensitive) and the specified specialty.
//    - Instruction: Ensure that both name and specialty are considered when filtering doctors.


// 15. **filterDoctorByTimeAndSpecility Method**:
//    - Filters doctors based on their specialty and availability during a specific time period (AM/PM).
//    - Fetches doctors based on the specified specialty and filters them based on their available time slots for AM/PM.
//    - Instruction: Ensure the time filtering is accurately applied based on the given specialty and time period (AM/PM).

// 16. **filterDoctorBySpecility Method**:
//    - Filters doctors based on their specialty.
//    - This method fetches all doctors matching the specified specialty and returns them.
//    - Instruction: Make sure the filtering logic works for case-insensitive specialty matching.

// 17. **filterDoctorsByTime Method**:
//    - Filters all doctors based on their availability during a specific time period (AM/PM).
//    - The method checks all doctors' available times and returns those available during the specified time period.
//    - Instruction: Ensure proper filtering logic to handle AM/PM time periods.
